## Future features:
1. Bigger question pool: I plan to include more questions to associate the pet seeking method. Some just are not enough.

2. User profile: a profile for each user will enable them to continue later or save their personal proffered spit of some pet. I currently clear the user input after the recommendation.

3. Care advice: once a person finds the ideal pet, I want to add a tip section where based on their selected pet, the program will locate and show pet care tips.

4. GUI: add graphical user interface or develop a web platform of the program for more engagement. Itâ€™ll also allow us to use the database of pet breeds with different images.

5. Space for creative writing and a community forum for pet owner question answering or voluntary sharing of experience.

6. Mobile app. Due to the amount of free time, people spend using their phones, I plan to add a mobile version of the program to use it on the go.

## Fixes for ascii art and title

![example_output](images-readme/invalidescape.png)

- Added 'r prefix for raw strings to the ASCII art strings and the title string to
make them work in the terminal. This was necessary to handle backslashe correctly.
- With this correction, the code  resets the style changes properly when displaying
the ASCII art for the cat.
